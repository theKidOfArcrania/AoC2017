# Advent of Code 2017

This repository contains all of my AoC solutions. Link to the 
[Advent of code website](http://adventofcode.com). With some levels, I divided
the code into two separate files dx\_1 and dx\_2. With others I have combined
them into one file. The majority of the code written is done in python 3.
